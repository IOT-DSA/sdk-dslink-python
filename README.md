# DSLink SDK for Python

DSLink SDK for Python.

**This DSLink SDK isn't finished yet. Responder features are usable, but not stable yet. Requester features are not implemented.**

## Using the SDK
We're publishing the DSLink package to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dslink).
For Windows, you'll need [Win32OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).
The SDK currently only supports **Python 3** at this time.

## Developing the SDK

### Windows Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install OpenSSL from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.
3. ```python setup.py install```

### Linux

1. Clone this repository.
2. ```sudo python setup.py install```

## Running the examples

There are a few examples that you can run to demonstrate how you'd use the SDK. They are located in the examples directory in the root of the repository.
Follow the steps above to locally install the package, and then you may run them.
